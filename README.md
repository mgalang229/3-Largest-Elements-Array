WHOLE PROCESS:

		third = second -> 0
		second = first -> 0
		first = arr[i] -> 112
		
		third = second -> 0
		second = first -> 112
		first = arr[i] -> 434
		
		third = second -> 112
		second = first -> 434
		first = arr[i] -> 765
		
		third = second -> 434
		second = arr[i] -> 578
		
		Output : 765 578 434
